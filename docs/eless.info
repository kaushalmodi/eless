https://travis-ci.org/kaushalmodi/eless.svg?branch=master
(https://travis-ci.org/kaushalmodi/eless) | *Documentation*
(https://eless.scripter.co)

   *eless* (https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless) is a combination of
Bash script and a minimal emacs ‘view-mode’ config.

   This script is designed to:

   • Be portable – Just one bash script to download to run
   • Be independent of a user’s emacs config
        • _You can still customize
          (https://eless.scripter.co/#user-config-override) the ‘eless’
          config if you like._
   • Not require an emacs server to be already running

   It was created out of a need to have something _like_ ‘less’ (in the
sense of _launch quickly, do, and quit_, but _better_ in these ways:

   • Syntax highlighting
   • Org-mode file rendering
   • A better navigable man page viewer
   • A better Info viewer
   • Dired, especially ‘wdired’ (batch edit symbolic links, for
     example?)
   • Colored diffs, ‘git diff’, ‘git log’, ‘ls’, etc.  (auto ANSI
     detection)
   • Filter log files to only show (or not show) lines matching a regexp
   • Auto-revert log files when I want (like ‘tail -f’)
   • Quickly change frame and font sizes
   • ..  and more; basically everything that emacs has to offer!

   I call it ‘eless’ and here’s a little taste of what it looks like:

   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/eless/master/docs/images/eless-examples.png
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/eless/master/docs/images/eless-examples.png)

   _Shown above, starting from top left image and proceeding
clock-wise.._
   • ‘eless eless.org’
   • ‘rg --color=ansi 'man pages' | eless’ (rg?
     (https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep))
   • ‘man grep’ (I have set my ‘PAGER’ env var to ‘eless’.)
   • ‘info eless’ (I have aliased ‘info’ to ‘'\info \!* | eless'’ in my
     tcsh shell.)
   • ‘eless .’ (Shows the current directory contents in ‘dired’.)
   • ‘diff’ of ‘eless.org’ with an older saved version and piping the
     result to ‘eless’

   *Meta Features*

   • This script passes ShellCheck (http://www.shellcheck.net), and
   • Unofficial Bash strict mode
     (http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode) is
     enabled.
   • Always-in-sync documentation as the ‘eless’ script and
     documentation are generated using Org Babel from one file
     (https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/blob/master/eless.org) (even
     this README).
   • The documentation site (https://eless.scripter.co) is generated
     on-the-fly on Netlify using that same _one file_.
   • This bash script has tests too!

1.1 Requirements
================

Software   Details
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‘emacs’    If only *running* the ‘eless’ script, the mininum required emacs version is 22.1 (manually tested).  If *developing* (running ‘make all html test’), the minimum required version is *24.4* (24.4 onwards versions are auto-tested on Travis).
‘bash’     This is a ‘bash’ script.  So even if you don’t use ‘bash’ shell, you need to have the ‘bash’ binary discoverable through your environment variable ‘PATH’.  _Tested to work in ‘tcsh’ shell on RHEL 6.6._
‘perl’     Perl is used to replace ‘grep -Po’ and case-insensitive ‘sed’ based replacements (using ‘/I’) as those features are available only in GNU versions of ‘grep’ and ‘sed’ (which are not present by default on _macOS_ systems).  _Tested with Perl v5.16.3 on RHEL
           6.6._

NOTE
     If the environment variable ‘EMACS’ is set, ‘eless’ uses that as
     the emacs binary, else it defaults to using ‘emacs’ as emacs
     binary.

1.2 Try it out
==============

Here are some usage examples:
     eless foo.txt                      # Open foo.txt in eless in terminal (-nw) mode by default.
     eless foo.txt --gui                # Open foo.txt in eless in GUI mode.
     echo 'foo' | eless                 #
     echo 'foo' | eless -               # Same as above. The hyphen after eless does not matter; is anyways discarded.
     grep 'bar' foo.txt | eless         #
     diff foo bar | eless               # Colored diff!
     diff -u foo bar | eless            # Colored diff for unified diff format
     eless .                            # Open dired in the current directory (enhanced 'ls')
     ls --color=always | eless          # Auto-detect ANSI color codes and convert those to colors
     PAGER=eless git diff               # Show git diff with ANSI coded colors
     eless -h | eless                   # See eless help ;-)
     info emacs | eless                 # Read emacs Info manual in eless
     eless foo.tar.xz                   # Read the contents of archives; emacs does the unarchiving automatically
     PAGER=eless python3; help('def')   # Read (I)Python keyword help pages (example: help for 'def' keyword)
     PAGER=eless python3; help('shlex') # Read (I)Python module help pages (example: help for 'shlex' module)
     PAGER=eless python3; help('TYPES') # Read (I)Python topic help pages (example: help for 'TYPES' topic)
     PAGER=eless man grep               # Launches man pages in eless (terminal mode), if the env var PAGER is set to eless.
     PAGER="eless --gui" man grep       # Launches man pages in eless (GUI mode), if the env var PAGER is set to "eless --gui".
NOTE
     Above examples are tested to work in a *‘bash’ shell*.
     Specifically, examples like ‘PAGER=eless man grep’ will need to be
     adapted for the shell you are using.

7.1 Unofficial Bash Strict Mode
===============================

The _Unofficial Bash Strict Mode_
(http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/) is enabled
to make this script more robust and reliable.

   The script will error out immediately when,
  1. Any command in a pipeline in this code fails.
          set -o pipefail
  2. Any line in this script returns an error
          set -e # Error out and exit the script when any line in this script returns an error
  3. Any undefined variable is referenced.
          set -u # Error out when unbound variables are found

7.3 Cleanup using ‘trap’
========================

The below ‘cleanup’ function is auto-executed via Bash ‘trap’ when the
script exits _for any reason_.  Read this post on _redsymbol.net_
(http://redsymbol.net/articles/bash-exit-traps/) for more information.
     # http://redsymbol.net/articles/bash-exit-traps/

             rm -f "${piped_data_file}" "${piped_data_file}.noblank"
         fi
     }
     trap cleanup EXIT


File: eless.info,  Node: Debug function,  Next: Input/Output Detection,  Prev: Cleanup using trap,  Up: Code

7.4 Debug function
==================

This function redefines itself the first time it is called.  When
debugging is enabled, it defines itself as a function which outputs to
STDERR, then calls itself to do the first output.  When debugging is
disabled, it defines itself as a function that does nothing, so
subsequent calls do not output.
     function debug {
         if [[ $debug -eq 1 ]]
         then
             function debug {
                 echo -e "DEBUG: $*" >&2
             }
             debug "$@"
         else
             function debug {
                 true
             }
         fi
     }
   Above is a ‘bash’ _collapsing function_.  See here
(http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/howto/collapsing_functions) and here
(https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/issues/13) for more info.  If user
has passed the ‘-D’ option, run the script in debug mode.

     for var in "$@"
     do
         if [[ "${var}" == '-D' ]]
         then
             eless_print_version
             export ELESS_DEBUG=1
             debug=1
         fi
     done


File: eless.info,  Node: Input/Output Detection,  Next: Parse options,  Prev: Debug function,  Up: Code

7.5 Input/Output Detection
==========================

We need this script to know:
   • Where it is getting the input from:
        • From the terminal?
                   eless foo
        • From a pipe?
                   diff a b | eless
   • Where the output is going to:
        • To the terminal?
                   eless foo
        • To a pipe?
                   eless | grep foo
          In this case, we do not do anything at the moment.  See here
          (https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/issues/4).

   Below code determines that using ‘[[ -t 0 ]]’ and ‘[[ -t 1]]’.
     # https://gist.github.com/davejamesmiller/1966557
     if [[ -t 0 ]] # Script is called normally - Terminal input (keyboard) - interactive
     then
         # eless foo
         # eless foo | cat -
         debug "--> Input from terminal"
         input_from_pipe_flag=0
     else # Script is getting input from pipe or file - non-interactive
         # echo bar | eless foo
         # echo bar | eless foo | cat -
         piped_data_file="$(mktemp -t emacs-stdin-"$USER".XXXXXXX)" # https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2086
         debug "Piped data file : $piped_data_file"
         # https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/issues/21#issuecomment-366141999
         cat > "${piped_data_file}"
         debug "--> Input from pipe/file"
         input_from_pipe_flag=1
     fi

     # http://stackoverflow.com/a/911213/1219634
     if [[ -t 1 ]] # Output is going to the terminal
     then
         # eless foo
         # echo bar | eless foo
         debug "    Output to terminal -->"
         output_to_pipe_flag=0
     else # Output is going to a pipe, file?
         # eless foo | cat -
         # echo bar | eless foo | cat -

7.6 Parse options
=================

We need to parse the arguments such that arguments specific to this
script like ‘-D’ and ‘--gui’ get consumed here, and the ones not known
to this script get passed to ‘emacs’.

   ‘getopt’ does not support ignoring undefined options.  So the below
basic approach of looping through all the arguments ‘"$@"’ is used.
     for var in "$@"
     do
         debug "var : $var"

         if [[ "${var}" == '-D' ]]
         then
             : # Put just a colon to represent null operation # https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/133976/57923
               # Do not pass -D option to emacs.
         elif [[ "${var}" == '-V' ]]
         then
             eless_print_version
             exit 0
         elif [[ "${var}" == '-' ]]
         then
             : # Discard the '-'; it does nothing. (for the cases where a user might do "echo foo | eless -")
         elif [[ "${var}" == '-nw' ]]
         then
             : # Ignore the user-passed "-nw" option; we are adding it by default.
         elif [[ "${var}" == '-h' ]]  # Do not hijack --help; use that to show emacs help
         then
             help=1
         elif [[ "${var}" == '--gui' ]]
         then
             # Delete the ${no_window_arg} from ${emacs_args[@]} array if user passed "--gui" option
             # http://stackoverflow.com/a/16861932/1219634
             emacs_args=("${emacs_args[@]/${no_window_arg}}")
         else
             # Collect all other arguments passed to eless and forward them to emacs.
             emacs_args=("${emacs_args[@]}" "${var}")

7.9 Input/Output Scenarios
==========================

We saw in section *note Input/Output Detection:: how we detected if
input was coming from the _pipe_ or _stdin_ and if output was going to a
_pipe_ or _stdout_.  Now we make use of that information to call the
‘emacs_Q_view_mode’ function with the right arguments.
     # Below if condition is reached if you try to do this:
     #   eless foo.txt | grep bar .. Not allowed!
     if [[ ${output_to_pipe_flag} -eq 1 ]]
     then
         <<output-pipe>>
     else
         # Below if condition is reached when you do this:
         #   grep 'foo' bar.txt | eless, or
         #   grep 'foo' bar.txt | eless -
         # i.e. Input to eless is coming through a pipe (from grep, in above example)
         if [[ ${input_from_pipe_flag} -eq 1 ]]
         then
             <<output-stdout--input-pipe>>
             # Below else condition is reached when you do this:
             #   eless foo.txt
         else
             <<output-stdout--input-stdin>>
         fi

7.9.1 Output is going to a pipe
-------------------------------

This scenario is not supported at the moment.  There is a plan to
support it in future (https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/issues/4)
though.

   For now, the ‘eless’ script will exit with an error code if the
output is being piped to something else.
     echo "This script is not supposed to send output to a pipe"
     exit 1

7.11.7.6 “Do The Right Thing” Kill
..................................

Before killing emacs, loop through all the buffers and mark all the
‘view-mode’ buffers as being unmodified (regardless of if they actually
were).  The ‘view-mode’ buffers would have been auto-marked as modified
if filtering commands like ‘eless/delete-matching-lines’,
‘eless/keep-lines’, etc.  were used.

   By overriding the state of these buffers as being unmodified, we are
saved from emacs prompting to save those modified ‘view-mode’ buffers at
the time of quitting.

8.1 How to help debug
=====================

   • If you find ‘eless’ not working as expected, file an issue
     (https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/issues).
   • Include the following debug information:
       1. ‘emacs --version’
       2. ‘eless’ debug info:
             • Append the ‘-D’ option to your ‘eless’ use case.
               Examples:
                  • ‘eless foo -D’
                  • ‘info org | eless -D’
             • If you are providing debug info for something like ‘man
               foo’, do
                  • ‘PAGER=​"eless -D" man foo’
