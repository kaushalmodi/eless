=eless= is a combination of Bash script and a minimal emacs =view-mode= config.

This script is designed to:

- Be portable -- Just one bash script to download to run
- Be independent of a user's emacs config
  - /You can still [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/wiki/Code-Explanation#user-config-override][customize]] the =eless= config if you like./
- Not require an emacs server to be already running

It was created out of a need to have something /like/ =less= (in the sense of
/launch quickly, do, and quit/, but /better/ in these ways:

- Syntax highlighting
- Org-mode file rendering
- A better navigable man page viewer
- A better Info viewer
- Dired, especially =wdired= (batch edit symbolic links, for
  example?)
- Colored diffs, =git diff=, =git log=, =ls=, etc. (auto ANSI detection)
- Filter log files to only show (or not show) lines matching a regexp
- Auto-revert log files when I want (like =tail -f=)
- Quickly change frame and font sizes
- .. and more; basically everything that emacs has to offer!

I call it =eless= and here's a little taste of what it looks like:

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/eless/master/doc/images/eless-examples.png][https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/eless/master/doc/images/eless-examples.png]]

/Shown above, starting from top left image and proceeding clock-wise../
- =eless eless.org=
- =rg --color=ansi 'man pages' | eless= (rg[[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][?]])
- =man grep= (I have set my =PAGER= env var to =eless=.)
- =info eless= (I have aliased =info= to ='\info \!* | eless'= in my
  tcsh shell.)
- =eless .= (Shows the current directory contents in =dired=.)
- =diff= of =eless.org= with an older saved version and piping the
  result to =eless=

As a bonus:

- [x] This script passes [[http://www.shellcheck.net][ShellCheck]], and
- [x] Unofficial Bash [[http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode][strict mode]] is enabled.
- [x] Always-in-sync documentation as the =eless= script and
  documentation are generated using Org Babel from [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/blob/master/eless.org][one file]] (even this
  README).

** Contributors
- Thanks to [[https://github.com/iqbalansari][Iqbal Ansari]] for adding support to read piped data in
  =emacs -Q -nw=.
- Thanks to [[https://github.com/alphapapa][Adam Porter]] for adding a =bash= /collapsing function/ for
  debug statements, and testing out and providing suggestions on
  improving the =eless= build flow.

** Unofficial Bash Strict Mode
The [[http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/][/Unofficial Bash Strict Mode/]] is enabled to make this script more
robust and reliable.

The script will error out immediately when,
1. Any command in a pipeline in this code fails.

2. Any line in this script returns an error

** Debug function
This function redefines itself the first time it is called.  When
debugging is enabled, it defines itself as a function which outputs to
STDERR, then calls itself to do the first output.  When debugging is
disabled, it defines itself as a function that does nothing, so
subsequent calls do not output.

We need this script to know:

  - From the terminal?

    eless foo
    #+END_SRC
  - From a pipe?
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell :tangle no

  - To a pipe?
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell :tangle no

    In this case, we do not do anything at the moment. See [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/issues/4][here]].

** Parse options
We need to parse the arguments such that arguments specific to this
script like =-D= and =--gui= get consumed here, and the ones not known
to this script get passed to =emacs=.

=getopt= does not support ignoring undefined options. So the below
basic approach of looping through all the arguments ="$@"= is used.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :noweb yes

    elif [[ "${var}" == '-nw' ]]
    then
        : # Ignore the user-passed "-nw" option; we are adding it by default.
    elif [[ "${var}" == '-h' ]]  # Do not hijack --help; use that to show emacs help
    then
        help=1

This scenario is not supported at the moment. There
[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/issues/4][is a plan to support it in future]] though.

For now, the =eless= script will exit with an error code if the output
is being piped to something else.

**** "Do The Right Thing" Kill
Before killing emacs, loop through all the buffers and mark all
the =view-mode= buffers as being unmodified (regardless of if they
actually were). The =view-mode= buffers would have been auto-marked
as modified if filtering commands like =eless/delete-matching-lines=,
=eless/keep-lines=, etc. were used.

By overriding the state of these buffers as being unmodified, we are
saved from emacs prompting to save those modified =view-mode= buffers
at the time of quitting.

This guide is for you if you'd like to do any of the below:
- Open an issue (plus provide debug information).
- Simply clone this repo and build =eless= locally.
- Do above + Provide a PR.
** How to help debug
- If you find =eless= not working as expected, file an [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/issues][issue]].
- Include the following debug information:
  1. =emacs --version=
  2. =eless= debug info:
     - Append the =-D= option to your =eless= use case. Examples:
       - =eless foo -D=
       - =info org | eless -D=
     - If you are providing debug info for something like =man foo=, do
       - =PAGER=​"eless -D" man foo=
** Development
*** Dependencies
Here's a short list of dependencies if you would like to build =eless=
and the documentation from =eless.org=:

1. Org version 9.x -- Latest version of Org from Melpa or Org Elpa
2. =htmlize= package for syntax highlighting of code in html exports
   -- Melpa
3. =rainbow-delimiters= package for syntax highlighting of parenthese
   in elisp code in html exports -- Melpa

The recommended way is to run =emacs -Q= and then run =M-x
eless-install-dependencies= to install the dependencies in your
=temporary-file-directory=. /You can choose to even install these
manually in your emacs config if you like./

I used the latest emacs and org-mode versions built from their =master=
branches for this project. So if any of the below steps do not work
for you, open an issue!

Talking about dependencies, this project builds *everything* from
=eless.org= file, the =eless= script /plus/ all the HTML, Info
documentation, =README.org=, =CONTRIBUTING.org=, and even the Wiki
pages. So before running =M-x eless-build= mentioned in below build
steps, you also need to:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd doc/
git clone https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless.wiki.git
#+END_SRC
*** Steps to build =eless= and documentation
- =emacs -Q=
- *First* open a non-org file like =build/build.el= and *evaluate it*.
  - The emphasis on opening a non-org file is so that the
    older-than-required version of =org= in =emacs -Q= doesn't get
    auto-loaded.  The next step would be to install newer version of
    org to a temp location. That step would fail due to mixed org
    versions if the default org version got loaded first.
  - Evaluating this file will now allow you to run =M-x
    eless-install-dependencies= or =M-x eless-build=.
- Do =M-x eless-install-dependencies=.
  - You will need to do this step only for the very first time you
    start working on this project.
- Do =M-x eless-build=.
- Run the tangled =eless= through [[http://www.shellcheck.net/][shellcheck]] to ensure that there are
  no errors.
- Understand the changes made in =eless=, /plus/ all the other files.
  - I build the HTML documentation using the Org version from =master=
    branch. So if you build the HTML documentation using the latest
    stable as of today (version =9.0.7=), your HTML export will look a
    bit different (absence of nested =<code>= blocks inside =<pre>=),
    but that's OK.
  - Also the randomly generated hyperlinks and section numbers (if you
    added/removed/moved documentation sections) will be different in
    the HTML and Info exports.
  - .. and the =git rev-parse= returned commit hash will be different.
  - Other than that, you shouldn't see any unexpected changes.
- Provide a PR.
- If changes are only to the Wiki, I believe you can push them
  directly using =git= or manually edit those [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/wiki][here]]. /I have to yet
  figure out how to keep the non-git Wiki changes and changes in
  =eless.org= in sync./

This project in unique in the sense that *everything* is built from
=eless.org= file, the =eless= script /plus/ all the HTML, Info
documentation, =README.org=, =CONTRIBUTING.org=, and even these Wiki
pages.

So before running =M-x eless-build= mentioned in the
[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org][Contributing Guide]], you need to:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd doc/
git clone https://github.com/kaushalmodi/eless.wiki.git
#+END_SRC

If changes are only to this Wiki, I believe you can
push them directly using =git= or manually edit those here.

/I have to yet figure out how to sync those manual Wiki changes with
=eless.org=./
